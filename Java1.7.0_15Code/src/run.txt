Compilation/Running (mirrored in report)
Run the files either by executing the run.sh script or through these commands:
$ javac *.java
$ java Main <token spec file> <script> <table out> <token out> <grammar spec>
Neither <table out> not <token out> need exist, but errors in the others will be fatal to the program.
Output should follow the program's execution.
